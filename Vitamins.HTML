    <h1>Vitamins - Classification and Functions</h1>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Classification of Vitamins</h2>
        <p>Vitamins are essential organic compounds required in small amounts for various biological functions. They are broadly classified based on their solubility:</p>

        <div class="vitamin-group">
            <h3 class="vitamin-name">1. Fat-Soluble Vitamins</h3>
            <p>These vitamins are soluble in fats and oils and are absorbed along with dietary fats. They can be stored in the body's fatty tissues and liver.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Vitamin A (Retinol, Beta-Carotene):</b> Important for vision, immune function, skin health, and cell growth.</li>
                <li><b>Vitamin D (Calciferol):</b> Promotes calcium absorption, essential for bone health and immune function.</li>
                <li><b>Vitamin E (Tocopherol):</b> An antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Important for immune function and skin health.</li>
                <li><b>Vitamin K (Phylloquinone, Menaquinone):</b> Necessary for blood clotting and bone metabolism.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="vitamin-group">
            <h3 class="vitamin-name">2. Water-Soluble Vitamins</h3>
            <p>These vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored in the body to a significant extent. Excess amounts are typically excreted in urine, so regular intake is necessary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):</b> An antioxidant, important for immune function, collagen synthesis, and iron absorption.</li>
                <li><b>B Vitamins (B-Complex):</b> A group of eight vitamins with various functions, often involved in energy metabolism and nerve function.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B1 (Thiamine):</b> Helps convert carbohydrates into energy, important for nerve and muscle function.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin):</b> Involved in energy production, cell growth, and metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B3 (Niacin):</b> Important for energy metabolism, nerve function, and digestive system health.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid):</b> Involved in energy release from foods and hormone production.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):</b> Involved in protein metabolism, brain development, and immune function.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B7 (Biotin):</b> Important for metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and for healthy hair, skin, and nails.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B9 (Folate, Folic Acid):</b> Essential for cell division and DNA synthesis, crucial during pregnancy.</li>
                        <li><b>Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin):</b> Important for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Functions of Vitamins</h2>
        <p>Vitamins play crucial roles in numerous bodily functions, contributing to overall health and well-being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Metabolism:</b> Many B vitamins are essential coenzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, converting food into energy.</li>
            <li><b>Immune Function:</b> Vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, and folate are important for maintaining a healthy immune system and fighting off infections.</li>
            <li><b>Cell Growth and Development:</b> Vitamins A, B9 (folate), B12, and D are crucial for cell division, growth, and differentiation.</li>
            <li><b>Antioxidant Activity:</b> Vitamins C and E are powerful antioxidants that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.</li>
            <li><b>Bone Health:</b> Vitamins D and K are essential for maintaining strong and healthy bones by regulating calcium absorption and deposition.</li>
            <li><b>Blood Clotting:</b> Vitamin K is vital for the synthesis of blood clotting factors, preventing excessive bleeding.</li>
            <li><b>Nerve Function:</b> Several B vitamins (B1, B3, B6, B12) are important for the proper functioning of the nervous system.</li>
            <li><b>Vision:</b> Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining good eyesight, especially in low light conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Skin Health:</b> Vitamins A, C, and E contribute to healthy skin maintenance and repair.</li>
            <li><b>Collagen Synthesis:</b> Vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen, a protein that provides structure to skin, blood vessels, bones, and cartilage.</li>
            <li><b>Red Blood Cell Formation:</b> Vitamins B6, B9 (folate), and B12 are necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells.</li>
            <li><b>Hormone Regulation:</b> Some vitamins, like Vitamin D, act as hormones and regulate various bodily processes.</li>
        </ul>
